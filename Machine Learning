Machine learning fundamentals:

machine learning will look at the input data and the output data and will try to get the rules that turned the input into the output.
Rather than giving the program the rules, teh algorithm finds the rules for us.There are two layers. An input, the algorithm and the output.

A neural network is a form of machine learning that uses a layered representation of data.
The inputted data is transformed multiple times before an output is spitted out.


features are the input variables (or input information)
The label is the output.

Introduction to tensors and core machine learning algorithms:

A tensor is a generalised vector to higher dimensions

Linear regression is one of the most basic forms of machine learning and is used to predict numeric values. It looks for a linear correspondence.
Usinga  line of best fit we can predict future vaules.
